Welcome to my academic website!

I am a recent B.E. graduate in Software Engineering from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT).  
My research interests lie at the intersection of **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** and **Large Language Model (LLM) Agents**, particularly in:
- Structured decision-making under constraints
- Action decomposition and policy optimization
- Test-time enhancement and inference robustness of multimodal models

Please visit the [About](/about/) page for more details.
