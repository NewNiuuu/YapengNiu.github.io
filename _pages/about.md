I am a recent **B.E. graduate in Software Engineering** from **Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT)**. I am interested in **reinforcement learning** and **LLM-based agents**, and I am looking for Master's or Ph.D. research opportunities in these areas.

### Research Interests

- **Reinforcement Learning** — policy optimization, structured decision-making under constraints, action decomposition
- **LLM-based Agents** — sequential decision-making, test-time enhancement, inference robustness of multimodal models
- **Robust Sequential Decision-Making** — reliability and generalization of agent behavior in complex environments

---

### Experience

- **Undergraduate research** with the **Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ICT, CAS)** on neural model inference: latency, memory efficiency, and accuracy trade-offs.
- **Bachelor thesis**: test-time enhancement strategies for multimodal large models, which led to my current focus on how models make sequential decisions — a problem I approach through reinforcement learning.

---

### Goal

I plan to pursue a **Ph.D.** in the long term. I am currently seeking **Master's-level research opportunities** to deepen my work on **RL-driven agent systems** and contribute to more capable and robust autonomous decision-making in AI.
