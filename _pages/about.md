I am a recent B.E. graduate in **Software Engineering** from **Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT)**.

My research interests lie at the intersection of **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** and **Large Language Model (LLM) Agents**, particularly in:
- Structured decision-making under constraints
- Action decomposition and policy optimization
- Test-time enhancement and inference robustness of multimodal models

During my undergraduate studies, I systematically explored foundational deep learning architectures (e.g., ResNet, Transformer) and engaged in collaborative research with the **Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ICT, CAS)**, focusing on neural model inference latency, memory efficiency, and accuracy trade-offs.

My undergraduate thesis investigated **test-time enhancement strategies for multimodal large models**, which sparked my interest in how models make sequential decisions in complex environments — a problem naturally addressed by reinforcement learning.

I plan to pursue a Ph.D. in the long term and am currently seeking **Master’s-level research opportunities** to deepen my expertise in RL-driven agent systems and contribute to advancing autonomous decision-making in AI.
